The cyst in the cerebellum typically has several blood vessels running through it connecting to the brain, thereby prohibiting surgical removal\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001308\",\n            \"display\": \"Tongue fasciculations\",\n            \"definition\": \"Fasciculations or fibrillation affecting the tongue muscle\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001310\",\n            \"display\": \"Dysmetria\",\n            \"definition\": \"A type of ataxia characterized by the inability to carry out movements with the correct range and motion across the plane of more than one joint related to incorrect estimation of the distances required for targeted movements\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001311\",\n            \"display\": \"Abnormal nervous system electrophysiology\",\n            \"definition\": \"An abnormality of the function of the electrical signals with which nerve cells communicate with each other or with muscles as measured by electrophysiological investigations\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001312\",\n            \"display\": \"Giant somatosensory evoked potentials\",\n            \"definition\": \"An abnormal enlargement (i.e. increase in measured voltage) of somatosensory evoked potentials\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001315\",\n            \"display\": \"Reduced tendon reflexes\",\n            \"definition\": \"Diminution of tendon reflexes, which is an invariable sign of peripheral nerve disease\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001317\",\n            \"display\": \"Abnormal cerebellum morphology\",\n            \"definition\": \"Any structural abnormality of the cerebellum\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001319\",\n            \"display\": \"Neonatal hypotonia\",\n            \"definition\": \"Muscular hypotonia (abnormally low muscle tone) manifesting in the neonatal period\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001320\",\n            \"display\": \"Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia\",\n            \"definition\": \"Underdevelopment of the vermis of cerebellum\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001321\",\n            \"display\": \"Cerebellar hypoplasia\",\n            \"definition\": \"Underdevelopment of the cerebellum\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001322\",\n            \"display\": \"obsolete Brain very small\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001324\",\n            \"display\": \"Muscle weakness\",\n            \"definition\": \"Reduced strength of muscles\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001325\",\n            \"display\": \"Hypoglycemic coma\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001326\",\n            \"display\": \"EEG with irregular generalized spike and wave complexes\",\n            \"definition\": \"EEG shows spikes (<80 ms) and waves, which are recorded over the entire scalp and do not have a specific frequency\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001327\",\n            \"display\": \"Photosensitive myoclonic seizure\",\n            \"definition\": \"Generalised myoclonic seizure provoked by flashing or flickering light\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001328\",\n            \"display\": \"Specific learning disability\",\n            \"definition\": \"Impairment of certain skills such as reading or writing, coordination, self-control, or attention that interfere with the ability to learn.

These tinctorial properties contrast with the histologic appearance of collagen, a major component of basement membranes, mesangial matrix and areas of sclerosis, which demonstrates strong positivity for PAS and JMS (See Figure 1 of PMID:25852856)\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001919\",\n            \"display\": \"Acute kidney injury\",\n            \"definition\": \"Sudden loss of renal function, as manifested by decreased urine production, and a rise in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen concentration (azotemia)\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001920\",\n            \"display\": \"Renal artery stenosis\",\n            \"definition\": \"The presence of stenosis of the renal artery\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001922\",\n            \"display\": \"Vacuolated lymphocytes\",\n            \"definition\": \"The presence of clear, sharply defined vacuoles in the lymphocyte cytoplasm\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001923\",\n            \"display\": \"Reticulocytosis\",\n            \"definition\": \"An elevation in the number of reticulocytes (immature erythrocytes) in the peripheral blood circulation\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0001924\",\n            \"display\": \"Sideroblastic anemia\",\n            \"definition\": \"Sideroblastic anemia results from a defect in the incorporation of iron into the heme molecule.

Healthy subjects correct such perturbations with either one or two large steps, or without taking any steps, hinging rapidly at the hips while swinging the arms forward as a counterweight. In patients with balance impairment, balance correcting steps are often too small, forcing patients to take more than two steps.

Here, the term is used to describe hyperglycemia diagnosed at a young age with no or minor insulin dependency, no evidence of insulin resistence, and lack of evidence of autoimmune destruction of the beta cells\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004905\",\n            \"display\": \"Low levels of vitamin A\",\n            \"definition\": \"A reduced concentration of vitamin A\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004906\",\n            \"display\": \"Hypernatremic dehydration\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004909\",\n            \"display\": \"Hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004910\",\n            \"display\": \"Bicarbonate-wasting renal tubular acidosis\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004911\",\n            \"display\": \"Episodic metabolic acidosis\",\n            \"definition\": \"Repeated transient episodes of metabolic acidosis, that is, of the buildup of acid or depletion of base due to accumulation of metabolic acids\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004912\",\n            \"display\": \"Hypophosphatemic rickets\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004913\",\n            \"display\": \"Intermittent lactic acidemia\",\n            \"definition\": \"An intermittent (discontinuous) form of lactic acidemia\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004914\",\n            \"display\": \"Recurrent infantile hypoglycemia\",\n            \"definition\": \"Recurrent episodes of decreased concentration of glucose in the blood occurring during the infantile period\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004915\",\n            \"display\": \"Impairment of galactose metabolism\",\n            \"definition\": \"An impairment of galactose metabolism\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004916\",\n            \"display\": \"Generalized distal tubular acidosis\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004918\",\n            \"display\": \"Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004919\",\n            \"display\": \"Galactose intolerance\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004920\",\n            \"display\": \"Phenylpyruvic acidemia\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004921\",\n            \"display\": \"Abnormal magnesium concentration\",\n            \"definition\": \"An abnormality of magnesium ion homeostasis\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004922\",\n            \"display\": \"Atypical hyperphenylalaninemia\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004923\",\n            \"display\": \"Hyperphenylalaninemia\",\n            \"definition\": \"An increased concentration of L-phenylalanine in the blood\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004924\",\n            \"display\": \"Abnormal oral glucose tolerance\",\n            \"definition\": \"An abnormal resistance to glucose, i.e., a reduction in the ability to maintain glucose levels in the blood stream within normal limits following oral administration of glucose\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004925\",\n            \"display\": \"Chronic lactic acidosis\",\n            \"definition\": \"A chronic form of lactic acidemia\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004926\",\n            \"display\": \"Orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004927\",\n            \"display\": \"Pulmonary artery dilatation\",\n            \"definition\": \"An abnormal widening of the diameter of the pulmonary artery\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004928\",\n            \"display\": \"obsolete Peripheral arterial stenosis\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004929\",\n            \"display\": \"obsolete Coronary atherosclerosis\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004930\",\n            \"display\": \"Abnormality of the pulmonary vasculature\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004931\",\n            \"display\": \"Arteriosclerosis of small cerebral arteries\",\n            \"definition\": \"Arteriosclerosis (increased thickness, increased stiffness, loss of elasticity) of the small arteries of the brain\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0004933\",\n            \"display\": \"Ascending aortic dissection\",\n            \"definition\": \"A separation of the layers within the wall of the ascending aorta.

Based on echogenicity, a structure can be characterized as hyperechoic (white on the screen), hypoechoic (gray on the screen) and anechoic (black on the screen)\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0031143\",\n            \"display\": \"Decreased hepatic echogenicity\",\n            \"definition\": \"Reduced echogenicity of liver tissue on sonography, manifested as an increased amount of black on the screen of the sonography device\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0031144\",\n            \"display\": \"Coarsened hepatic echotexture\",\n            \"definition\": \"The appearance of the liver in sonographic images is normally uniform.

Contrast-sensitivity measurements differ from acuity measurements; acuity is a measure of the spatial-resolving ability of the visual system under conditions of very high contrast, whereas contrast sensitivity is a measure of the threshold contrast for seeing a target\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0032037\",\n            \"display\": \"Mildly reduced visual acuity\",\n            \"definition\": \"Mild reduction of the ability to see defined as visual acuity less than 6/12 (20/40 in US notation; 0.5 in decimal notation) but at least 6/18 (20/63 in US notation; 0.32 in decimal notation)\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0032039\",\n            \"display\": \"Abnormality of the ocular adnexa\",\n            \"definition\": \"An anomaly of the adjacent structures (i.e., adnexa) of the eye, defined as the lacrimal apparatus, the extraocular muscles and the eyelids, eyelashes, eyebrows and the conjunctiva\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0032040\",\n            \"display\": \"Abnormal ocular adnexa physiology\",\n            \"definition\": \"A functional anomaly of the adjacent structures (i.e., adnexa) of the eye, defined as the lacrimal apparatus, the extraocular muscles and the eyelids, eyelashes, eyebrows and the conjunctiva\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0032041\",\n            \"display\": \"Vocal cord polyp\",\n            \"definition\": \"A small growth on a vocal cord that may appear as pedunculated or sessile and have varying size, shape, and color\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0032043\",\n            \"display\": \"Odynophagia\",\n            \"definition\": \"Pain experienced with swallowing\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0032044\",\n            \"display\": \"Decreased vigilance\",\n            \"definition\": \"A reduction in the ability to maintain sustained attention characterized by reduced alertness\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0032045\",\n            \"display\": \"Hypoplastic carotid canal\",\n            \"definition\": \"Underdevelopment of the carotid canal, which normally is a circular aperture in the temporal bone of the skull through which the internal carotid artery and the carotid plexus of nerves traverse\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"code\": \"HP:0032046\",\n            \"display\": \"Focal cortical dysplasia\",\n            \"definition\": \"A type of malformation of cortical development that primarily affects areas of neocortex.
